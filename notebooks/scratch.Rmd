This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
```{r}
barselstuen_index1 <-barselstuen_raw %>% filter(index == "1")
barselstuen_index1

## if (spoke==NA) use index 2
barselstuen_spoke <- barselstuen_raw %>% filter(!is.na(spoke))
barselstuen_spoke

barselstuen_spoke2 <- barselstuen_raw %>% filter(index == "2", !is.na(spoke))
barselstuen_spoke2

b <- barselstuen_spoke1 %>% select(act, scene)
b

rows_update(barselstuen_spoke2, tibble(b = "z", a = 2:3), barselstuen_spoke1)




## if (spoke==NA) use index 2
for (val in barselstuen_index1)
{
if (is.na(val[spoke])) {
val <- (barselstuen_raw %>% 
  filter(index == "2"))
}
}




barselstuen_raw %>% select(scene_number, speaker) %>% group_by(act_number,scene_number) %>% distinct() %>% summarise( speakers =paste(collect_list(speaker))) 
```
